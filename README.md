# Fixcord

This application allows the user to control a Discord bot.

This is **not** a 3rd party Discord client.

# Why?
I wanted to get expreience in the UWP platform.
When I used Discord and the application did not work like it was supposed to, I created this project.
I do not think there is an actual use case for this.

Again, this is not a 3rd party Discord client.

# What does it do?
The user has to enter a valid Discord bot api token.

It allows the user to read and write messages in all channels the bot is allowed to, over multiple guilds/server.

Also it has notification support.

If enabled in the settings, a new window opens for each opened channel.
By clicking Ctrl while doing so the space in the main window can be used.
